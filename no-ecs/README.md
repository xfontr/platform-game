# This was a first try intro Pixi

I did not know about ECS when I started this. It eventually came up and soon enough I realised I was not going to reinvent the wheel with a first try.

I actually kinda liked the outcome, but I also realised this was not going to scale well. I'm still storing it apart, just for the memories. A few utils and the asset management were kinda satisfying to develop.

**Old readme:**

### Code quality standards

Will try to ship good code, but I'll skip my usual super-strict setup: This time I choose a short-sighted approach with fast delivery in mind.

### Linting

Might add in the future, by now we opt for minimal setup.

### Formatting

No autoformatter setup for now: only one dev working on this.

### Commit and push hooks

For now, skipping

### Testing

As of now unit testing and, particularly, TDD, is helping me to experiment new patterns and speed up my dev time. As soon as it stops being efficient, will also cut testing.
