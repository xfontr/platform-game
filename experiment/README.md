# This was a first try intro Pixi

I actually kinda liked the outcome but I very quickly realised this was not going to scale well. I'm still storing it apart, just for the memories.

**Old readme:**

### Code quality standards

Will try to ship good code, but I'll skip my usual super-strict setup: This time I choose a short-sighted approach with fast delivery in mind.

### Linting

Might add in the future, by now we opt for minimal setup.

### Formatting

No autoformatter setup for now: only one dev working on this.

### Commit and push hooks

For now, skipping

### Testing

As of now unit testing and, particularly, TDD, is helping me to experiment new patterns and speed up my dev time. As soon as it stops being efficient, will also cut testing.
